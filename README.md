# Diabetes Prediction Accuracy Test

This project uses machine learning techniques to predict diabetes outcomes based on the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset. It involves data loading, exploration, and potentially model training using libraries like XGBoost. The Jupyter notebook `Diabetes_Prediction_Accuracy_Test.ipynb` demonstrates the initial steps, including importing libraries, loading the dataset, and displaying the data.

## Description

The goal of this project is to build and evaluate a predictive model for diabetes diagnosis using features such as pregnancies, glucose levels, blood pressure, and more. The notebook sets up the environment by importing necessary libraries and loading the dataset. Future extensions could include data preprocessing, model training (e.g., with XGBoost), evaluation, and visualization.

This is a beginner-friendly project for practicing data science and machine learning workflows.

## Dataset

The dataset used is `diabetes.csv`, which contains 768 records with 9 features:
- Pregnancies
- Glucose
- BloodPressure
- SkinThickness
- Insulin
- BMI
- DiabetesPedigreeFunction
- Age
- Outcome (target variable: 0 for non-diabetic, 1 for diabetic)

This is the standard Pima Indians Diabetes dataset, commonly used for binary classification tasks.

Source: The dataset is publicly available and can be downloaded from sources like Kaggle or UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
  - numpy
  - pandas
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
  - xgboost

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/diabetes-prediction-accuracy-test.git
   cd diabetes-prediction-accuracy-test
   ```

2. Install dependencies using pip:
   ```
   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn xgboost
   ```

   Alternatively, use a requirements file if available:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed:
   ```
   pip install notebook
   ```

## Usage

1. Place the `diabetes.csv` file in the project directory (or update the path in the notebook).

2. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```
   jupyter notebook
   ```

3. Open `Diabetes_Prediction_Accuracy_Test.ipynb` and run the cells step by step.

   - Cell 1: Import libraries.
   - Cell 2: Load the CSV file.
   - Cell 3: Display the dataframe.

Extend the notebook for model training, e.g., splitting data, training XGBoost, and evaluating accuracy.

## Results

(Placeholder: Add your results here after running the model, e.g., accuracy scores, confusion matrix, etc.)

- Example: Model accuracy on test set: ~75-80% (depending on preprocessing and hyperparameters).

Visualizations (if added): Use seaborn/matplotlib for feature correlations or distributions.
